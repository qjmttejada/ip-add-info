## Breakout Room Activity 7.1 | Project Activity 3: Social Coding 

Option 2: New Code - Create an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application
Your manager has received a request from the engineering department for a prototype of a new application that will provide IP addressing information to network technicians.

Search the internet for REST APIs that retrieve a user's current public IPv4 address and IPv6 address, such as ipapi.co or ipsstack.com. Using the public APIs, create a Python application that displays and formats the computer’s current public IP addressing information.

Depending on the API you select, you may also obtain geolocation information, the provider (ISP), the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the ISP, and country code.

Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.

Note: The objectives and specific tasks of your project will depend on the options provided by the IP information API you choose.

Rubric/Deliverable: The application that your team will work on and the reasons for your choice.

## Breakout Room Activity 9.1 | Project Activity 4

In this activity, you will complete the following tasks:

Design an automated testing process.
Implement your automated testing process.
Refer to the DEVASC Project Rubric below for this activity to record your process and outcomes.

Scenario
The marketing department has received very favorable reviews and feedback about your application. Your manager has acquired funding and resources for your team to add some of the backlog features to your application.

As your team continues working on the code, each team member contributes to your shared application codebase on GitHub with their changes. Despite the fact that you are trying to do doing manual code reviews for each commit, or pull request, sometimes a team member’s change will break some functionality in the application. Many times, such issues are identified only when the application is deployed and running. This usually leads to long troubleshooting sessions and slows down the development.

To eliminate the issues from above and ease development, your team has been asked to use some of the best practices from the DevOps methodology. Design a testing process that would be triggered automatically by GitHub whenever there is a new commit to the codebase. Only if all the test cases are passed, can the committed change be merged, or further used. Your manager has recommended that, in addition to Jenkins, explore other CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc., that might help you to build this automated CI/CD pipeline.

Deliverable/Rubric:

Which features did your team choose to implement from your backlog?
What are the specific objectives of these features?
Why were these features chosen?
Document your team member roles, knowledge and skillsets, if anything has changed in relation to this new Project Activity.
Provide a brief description of your team strategy for completing this project if anything has changed in relation to this new Project Activity.
Final Deliverables
At this point, your project has been completed. Your team will present to your manager:

Presentation
Team activities and reflection
Presentation
Deliverable/Rubric: Create a presentation about the project you selected. Your presentation should include:

Application code with new features
Show changes pushed to GitHub
Provide test cases used
Describe CI/CD pipeline functionality
Reflection points – what issues have you faced while working on this activity, how did you find solutions, what have you learned, etc.
Team Activities and Reflection
Deliverable/Rubric: Your manager is interested in knowing how everyone is continuing to work together as a team. Here is a list of questions from your manager:

What did you enjoy about working as a team? What worked well?
What team problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
What technical problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
How was each team member held accountable individually and for the team as a whole?
What was your team's decision-making process?
Overall, how were the team dynamics and what were any lessons learned?
