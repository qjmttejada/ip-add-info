# ip-add-info
Breakout Room Activity 7.1 | Project Activity 3: Social Coding 

Option 2: New Code - Create an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application
Your manager has received a request from the engineering department for a prototype of a new application that will provide IP addressing information to network technicians.

Search the internet for REST APIs that retrieve a user's current public IPv4 address and IPv6 address, such as ipapi.co or ipsstack.com. Using the public APIs, create a Python application that displays and formats the computerâ€™s current public IP addressing information.

Depending on the API you select, you may also obtain geolocation information, the provider (ISP), the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the ISP, and country code.

Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.

Note: The objectives and specific tasks of your project will depend on the options provided by the IP information API you choose.

Rubric/Deliverable: The application that your team will work on and the reasons for your choice.
